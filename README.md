The East West University Club Voting System enables students to cast votes for their preferred candidates in a secure and organized manner. The system consists of two main panels:  

1. User Panel:
   Students can log in to the user panel to vote for their chosen candidates.  
   Login credentials are secured with encrypted authentication, ensuring the privacy and integrity of user data.  

2. Admin Panel:
   The admin panel allows administrators to manage the entire voting process.  
   Key functionalities include setting a voting period and monitoring real-time results.  
   After the specified voting time ends, the admin panel automatically processes and announces the winner.  

This system streamlines the voting process while ensuring security, transparency, and fairness for all participants.
